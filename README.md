# Energy-consumption-prediction
A Data Science project predicting building energy consumption using regression models. This project predicts the heating and cooling loads of buildings based on architectural features using regression models.

## Dataset
- The dataset can be found at [UCI Energy Efficiency Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/energy+efficiency).
- The data contains 768 samples with 8 features and 2 target variables (Heating Load, Cooling Load).

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Performance
- **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** were the best performing models for both heating and cooling load predictions.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Hanoch123/Energy-consumption-prediction.git`
2. Install necessary libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook.
